First of, what's my job as a Backend Developer?

As a Back-End Developer, my job is to build and maintain the "server-side" of web applications. This means i will focus on the parts of an application that users don't directly see but are essential for it to function properly.

//You know
The Server-Side Logic
Writing code that handles the logic of how the application works.
Ensuring requests from the front-end (what users see) are processed correctly.

API Development
Creating and managing APIs that allows the front-end to communicate with the back-end.
Designing endpoints for actions like user authentication, fetching data, or saving information.

Database Management
Designing and managing databases that store the application’s data (e.g., user accounts, transactions).
Writing queries to retrieve, update, or delete data.

Security
Ensure the application is secure by implementing authentication (e.g., JWT) and authorization (e.g., user roles).
Protect sensitive data, such as passwords and personal user information.

Performance Optimization
Optimize code and database queries for speed and scalability.
Ensure the back-end can handle high traffic without crashing.

Testing and Debugging
Test the back-end code to ensure it works as intended.
Debug issues that arise in the server, API, or database.

Collaboration with Front-End Developers
Work closely with front-end developers to ensure smooth communication between the UI (user interface) and back-end systems.
Provide the necessary APIs and data formats for the front-end.

Deployment and Maintenance
Deploy the back-end to servers or cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure).
Monitor and maintain the back-end to ensure it remains operational.

User Management: •⁠ ⁠User registration and login with JWT authentication. •⁠ ⁠User roles: Admin and Regular User. •⁠ ⁠Only Admins can create other Admins.

Task Management: •⁠ ⁠Users can create tasks with a title, description, due date, and status (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Completed). •⁠ ⁠Users can assign tasks to themselves or others. •⁠ ⁠Users can update the status of their own tasks. •⁠ ⁠Admins can update the status of any task.

Tagging System: •⁠ ⁠Users can add tags to tasks (e.g., "Urgent", "Bug", "Feature"). •⁠ ⁠Users can filter tasks by tag.

Commenting System: •⁠ ⁠Users can add comments to tasks. •⁠ ⁠Users can edit or delete their own comments. •⁠ ⁠Admins can delete any comment.
Database: •⁠ ⁠MySQL was used with migrations for setting up the database schema.
